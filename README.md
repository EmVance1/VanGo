# MS Compile (MSBuild was taken)

Yes millions of options are lovely, but actually what's wrong with sensible defaults? Use JSON to define a minimal build script, for example:
```
{
    "project": "example",
    "cpp": "C++20",
    "dependencies": []
}
```
The above configuration is already the minimum requirement. `./src` is assumed as the main source file directory (what the hell else are you putting there?) and added to the include path. `./bin` holds any incremental build files (usually object files).
### Features supported so far
- New, Build, Run, Test, and Clean actions

- Specify header-only and binary libraries with a lib.json, supports multiple configurations...
```
{
    "library": "SFML",
    "minstd" : "c++11",
    "include": "include/",
    "configs": {
        ...
    }
},
```
- ...and plug and play at will in main project. Libraries can be placed in `./lib` or specified otherwise
```
"dependencies": [ "SFML.static", "../Rusty" ],
```
- Incremental building based on recent file changes

- Source code dependencies are automatically built recursively in the case of updates

- Preprocessor definitions
```
"defines": [ "MACRO" ],
"defines": [ "VALUE=10" ],
```
- Precompiled headers were never easier
```
"pch": "pch.h",
```
- Executable/Library output deduction using main.cpp/lib.h entry points

- Debug and Release configurations (work in progress)
```
"SETTING.debug": { ... },
"SETTING.release": { ... },
```

### It just works
Slap a `build.json` next to a `src` directory with a `main.cpp` in it and everything will just work. Was that so hard Microsoft? No Visual Studio needed.

## How-to:
The build system is invoked like so:

- `mscmp n[ew]   [-lib] [-c] name`
- `mscmp b[uild] [-r[elease]]`
- `mscmp r[un]   [-r[elease]] [args...]`
- `mscmp t[est]  [-r[elease]]`
- `mscmp c[lean]`

MSCMP is opinionated for simplicity and makes some base assumptions: you have a valid build script in the project root (`build.json`), all of your source files are in the `src` directory, and it will place all output files in `bin/{config}/`. Your output executable is named the same as your project. In the `run` action, all extraneous arguments are passed to the invoked executable.

### How-to: build.json
All `build.json` files are expected to have 3 base declarations at the root:

- `"project": "foobar"`
- `"cpp": "C++XX"`
- `"dependencies": [ ... ]`

`project` is an arbitrary string that defines how your project is viewed in the builder. This is for example the name the builder will look for when resolving source dependencies (see later). `cpp` takes any valid C++ standard, necessarily prefixed by `"C++"` (case insensitive). It also takes `"CXX"` if you want to build pure C projects.

`dependences` is the main workhorse of the build system. It takes 0 or more strings representing libraries also supported by MSCMP. If no path to the library is specified, MSCMP will search in `./lib`. The dependency string also supports an optional version, separated by a ':' (see chapter on library version definitions) as in `SFML:static`. A dependency must have a definition in its root directory. This may either be a `build.json` for source, or a `lib.json` for binary or header only libraries. Source libraries will be automatically built recursively by any project that includes them.

Preprocessor definitions can be loaded through the optional `defines` array. By default, this array will contain `"DEBUG"` or `"RELEASE"` definitions, aswell as `"TEST"` for test builds.

If you want to precompile a header, just specify the header file at the root of `src/` that you want precompiled as shown above (All source files will be assumed to use it).

Source directory and (project) include directories are assumed to be `./src` and `[ ./src ]` respectively, however they can be overridden or appended to through the `srcdir` and `incdirs` options.

If the project you are defining is going to be a library, you may want to add an `include-public` field. This is a string that tells dependency resolution that this directory should be used as the public interface (as opposed to `src` by default).

For finer control, the option is provided to pass compiler and linker flags directly, using `compiler-options` and `linker-options` array fields.

### How-to: lib.json
A `lib.json` file specifies for prebuilt libraries how they should be correctly linked. It must contain:

- `"library": "foobar"`
- `"minstd": "C++XX"`
- `"include": "include/"`

`minstd` declares compatibility. Dependency resolution will error on any library that requires a newer C++ standard than the project linking it. In the case of mixing C and C++, the builder assumes all C to be C++ compatible for ease of use, but the user must insure that this is in fact the case (i.e. no designated initializers in header files etc.).

In addition, all libraries must have one of the following (but not both):

- `"all": { ... }`
- `"configs": { "name": { ... }, ... }`

Configs represent different ways of linking a given library, for example if a library supports both static and dynamic linking. It is defined by 3 required fields

- `"links": [ ... ]`
- `"binary.debug": "foo/"`
- `"binary.release": "bar/"`

as well as an optional field for version specific preprocessor flags

- `"defines": [ "MACRO" ]`

The `all` field represents a standard configuration if versions are not necessary for a project.

### How-to: automated testing
Testing is made easy by assuming all tests are in a `test/` directory in the project root. Your test project may be arbitrarily complex as long as it contains a `main` function that executes the tests. A set of convenience macros are provided in the headers `mscmptest/asserts.h`, and `mscmptest/casserts.h` respectively, which is in the default include path for test configurations. Using these, you can write tests like in any other language, and run them in your `main` function by calling `test(test_function)`. The C version of these tests must however always `return TestOk;` at the end.
